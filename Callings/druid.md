# Druid
> Author: jennraeross

Where other practitioners gain their magic through study or outside sources of power, the humble Druid instead adopts practices to keep themselves attuned to the world around them, learning to imitate the miracles of nature. They tend to avoid aligning themselves strongly with political forces or extraplanar entities, preferring to keep to themselves and guard the wild places from which they learned their art.

## Calling Overview

**Typical Druids** Wise Hermits, Cunning Wildlings, Weary Travelers, and Precocious Animal Lovers.

**Abilities** Druids often find themselves without peer in navigating and surviving the wilderness, given their understanding of the natural world. In combat, they are capable of hindering their enemies from afar, causing the very land around them to fight on their behalf.

**Advancement** Druids find themselves with a wider variety of magics to call on as they rise in Rank.

**Aptitudes** The rough and tumble life of a druid leads to an abundance of Grit, but the inherent loneliness of the vocation makes social interaction, and the resultant Aura, difficult to obtain.

**Who'd like to be a Druid?** Those who feel particularly drawn to the natural world, or a particular attachment to animals will find themselves at home in the calling of a Druid.
