# Priestess

Priestesses (or Priests, we don't discriminate) practice the traditional Bright Magic of their Religion, passed down by rote over the centuries. They excel at protecting and empowering their friends, and derive power from the sheer force of their Faith.

## Calling Overview

**Typical Priestesses** Wandering Preachers, Traditional Shrine Maidens, Eccentric Seers, and Kindhearted Healers. 

**Abilities** The Bright Magic of a Priestess has a strong focus on support, healing, and divination. Within combat, parties with a priestess will find the odds sway subtly in their favor. Outside of combat, a Priestess capably keeps their allies in top condition and gathers needed information via divine revelation.

**Advancement** As Priestesses rise in Rank they master ever more potent magics and learn the arts of abjuring extraplanar or unholy entities.

**Aptitudes** Through years of steadily reinforcing their faith Priestesses gain a high Aura, but the relative comfort of their lifestyle in their holy buildings means they have relatively low Grit.

**Weapons and Armor** While they understand the very basics of fighting, Priestesses vastly prefer to stay out of direct Combat. They may use a limited number of weapons, and can wear Light Armor without trouble.

**Who'd like to be a Priestess?** The life of a Priestess is perfect for those who would prefer to spend their time healing and helping others rather than fighting directly.
