# Dryad

Unlike most other species, Dryads are not born, but awakened. They begin their lives as ordinary trees, which when exposed to sufficiently large amounts of mana over their lifetime will create a dryad as a magical construct. On rare occassions, a long lived tree may produce multiple Dryads over it's live span, which will be identical in appearance and temperament.

## Species Overview

#### **Physiology**

Dryads are tall beings, with wild hair that tends to rise toward the Light rather than fall down as gravity would typically dictate. In appearance, they take after their parent tree, with barklike skin, leaves growing from their hair, and rings in their eyes that increase in number with every year a dryad lives. As they do not reproduce, Dryads do not tend to think of themselves as male or female, though they learn to respond to whatever pronouns people tend to give them.

#### **Demeanor**

Given that they are created as adults, with no infancy, most Dryads tend to be very curious about the world around them, and to be perhaps overly trusting. They launch into whatever task has caught their attention with enthusiasm and energy. With that said, Dryads are typically difficult to ruffle. Trees can live much longer than a typical humanoid, so any who insult them won't be a problem for long in their perspective.

#### **Outlook**

After their long past life rooted in the ground, Dryads tend to observe the following priorities:

- Now possessing the gift of travel, seek out new places. 
- Do not let the little things remove your good spirit. Rain and Light both bring their own kind of nourishment.
- Never cease to grow, be that in body or mind.
- A great tree brings shelter and comfort to those who lack it.
- When someone would take fruit from you, it is an opportunity for you to plant seeds for the future.

#### **History**

The history of the Dryads is the history of the trees, recorded within them as they grow, and rotted away after their death. Most Dryads know little to nothing of their kind upon their awakening, and instead adapt to the culture they find themselves in.

#### **Adventurers**

Dryads are natural adventurers, having an eternal wanderlust. 

Their guileless nature makes them likely to try and help where they can.

#### **Typical Names**

As they have no parents to name them, Dryads are typically given names by the community that they are find in.

Naturally plant names are commonly chosen, but they will just as often have a name typical to communities they first find.

> - You have no need of food, instead producing your energy via photosynthesis, given sufficient exposure to bright light.
> - As long as you spend at least 8 hours per day in bright light, you are immune to Starvation.
