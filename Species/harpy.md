# Harpy

A reclusive people who rarely leave their mountain crags, Harpies are very territorial and dislike the presence of outsiders. Amid a harsh mountain environment, they have formed a society built on individual sacrifice for collective good.

## Species Overview

#### **Physiology**

While their exact origins are hazy, Harpies clearly have a closer link to birds than to mammals. Harpies typically stand between 3-4 feet tall, and are slender with a long armspan of 5-6 feet. They have vestigial pinion feathers along their limbs, which are regrettably not enough to enable flight under normal circumstances. Soft, fine plumage in a variety of colors lines most of their skin below the neck and crowns their head much like other species may have hair. In place of feet, Harpies retain a sharp set of talons.  

#### **Demeanor**

Harpy society is brutal and collectivist. In order to survive at such desolate altitudes, individual Harpies are expected to bring all that they find back to the Flock for distribution. Even then, there is never enough, and young ones quickly learn to never turn down an opportunity. When they leave the nest, these dual natures lead to a curious combination of scrounging and stealing from any who they judge can handle it, while being surprisingly generous to those they deem of equal or lesser status to themselves. 

#### **Outlook**

On the mountain crags, three tenets rule all behavior:

- You can never depend on another meal.
- Give to the Flock, so you may depend on them in turn.
- Those who hoard for themselves are a danger to the Flock. 


#### **History**

Harpies have long held isolationist views, not only against other species, but also against other Flocks. Their history is one of frequent tribal warfare and territory struggles.

#### **Adventurers**

Harpies almost never willingly leave their Flock, so adventurers are typically lonely and disillusioned. They are slow to trust.

When they find a group of people they can consider their new Flock, a Harpy adventure is known to be extremely loyal and generous with their resources. 

#### **Typical Names**

Harpy names typically consist of two single syllable parts, and they favor hard sounds, such as K, T and P.

Examples: Rok-Da, Pit-Ko, Tor-Gi, and Krag-Ma
