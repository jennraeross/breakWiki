# Kobold

Dwelling deep within their caves in the wild parts of the Buried Kingdom, Kobolds bide their time, always believing that the time for them to claim the surface for themselves will come. Self assured that their draconic appearance must mean they have relations to beings as mighty as the one that broke the Sun Machine, they really can't fathom any destiny for themselves that *doesn't* involve conquest and rule of the other species.

## Species Overview

#### **Physiology**

Kobolds are small beings, lizardlike in appearance, with scales in a variety of colors. They fancy that their draconic appearance means they are relatives to true Dragons, but there is little to no evidence for that actually being the case. Despite their pettiness and squabbles, they are actually very intelligent creatures with advanced brain development. When they get excited, their eyes have been known to glow like small embers.

#### **Demeanor**

Kobolds are very intelligent, crafting suprisingly advanced traps and structures out of scrap, and are very capable of organizing themselves for battle. At the same time, they are surprisingly childish in behavior, easily offended, and have difficulty realizing that other individuals have desires that may not perfectly mesh with their own.

#### **Outlook**

The Kobolds of the Buried Kingdom believe that one day one of them will ascend to their True Dragon form, and lead their society to victory. This ascension is said to be achieved by holding onto the values of a Dragon:

- A True Dragon accumulates power unceasingly, whether through power or gold.
- A True Dragon defends their territory with tooth and claw.
- A True Dragon takes is never caught off guard, and has a plan for every possible occurence.

#### **History**

If the Kobolds were asked after their history, they would tell of centuries of valiant wars led by truly Draconic warriors against the forces that were determined to keep their kind from their birthright. If anyone else in the Buried Kingdom were asked, they would describe the Kobolds as skirmishing nuisances, continually sending their warbands to wreak havoc before retreating in cowardice the moment any opposition showed up.

#### **Adventurers**

Kobold adventurers are typically those from the more prominent lineages, who have made a habit of sending their offspring to the surface for a time to learn the ways of battle and to steal any new techniques or technologies that may have been invented.

Kobold adventurers are unlikely to take to the frontlines, though not completely unheard of. Though they are known to be somewhat cowardly, it has long been an open secret that by playing off a Kobold adventurer's pride you can get them to join in activities that would scare away the boldest of adventurers.

#### **Typical Names**

Kobold names are usually a single syllable, and they favor 'S' sounds.

For example: Snugs, Mis, Eks, Sik, Sniv, Tes
